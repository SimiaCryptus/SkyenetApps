              Are you struggling to organize your thoughts or structure your writing? Say hello to the Outline Agent, your personal assistant for creating detailed outlines and essays!
    
              The Outline Agent is a sophisticated tool designed to help you turn a single idea into a well-structured document. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or a professional writer, this agent can streamline your writing process and enhance the clarity of your work.
    
              Here's what the Outline Agent can do for you:
    
              1. **Generate Initial Outlines**: Just provide your main idea or topic, and the Outline Agent will create an initial outline to kickstart your writing project.
              2. **Iterative Expansion**: The agent can iteratively expand on each section of your outline, adding depth and detail to your initial framework.
              3. **Finalize Your Essay**: Once your outline is fully expanded, the agent can compile it into a final essay, ensuring that your document is coherent and comprehensive.
              4. **Visualize Ideas**: If you're a visual learner, you'll love the Embedding Projector feature. It allows you to see a visual representation of your ideas and how they relate to each other.
              5. **Customizable Experience**: You can set the number of iterations for expanding your outline, the minimum size for sections, and whether you want to see the final essay or the projector visualization.
              6. **Interactive and User-Friendly**: With a user-friendly interface, the Outline Agent makes it easy to interact with the system, receive updates on the progress, and access your documents.
              7. **Safe and Secure**: Your data is stored securely, and you can access your session's directory to retrieve all your generated outlines and essays.
