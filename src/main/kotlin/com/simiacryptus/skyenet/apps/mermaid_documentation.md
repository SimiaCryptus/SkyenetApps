# coding\BashCodingApp.kt

To document the `BashCodingApp` class and its functionality using mermaid.js diagrams, we'll break down the process into several parts, focusing on the class structure, settings management, and the user message handling process. This approach will help in understanding the flow and interactions within the `BashCodingApp`.


#### 1. Class Overview

First, let's create a diagram to represent the overall class structure and its inheritance from `ApplicationServer`.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ApplicationServer {
        +String applicationName
        +String path
        +Class~*~ settingsClass
        +initSettings(Session) Any
        +userMessage(Session, User, String, ApplicationInterface, API)
    }
    class BashCodingApp {
        +Settings initSettings(Session)
        +userMessage(Session, User, String, ApplicationInterface, API)
    }
    ApplicationServer <|-- BashCodingApp: Inherits
```


#### 2. Settings Management

Next, we'll illustrate how `BashCodingApp` manages its settings through the `Settings` data class and the `initSettings` method.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BashCodingApp {
        +Settings initSettings(Session)
    }
    class Settings {
        -Map~String, String~ env
        -String workingDir
        -ChatModels model
        -Double temperature
        -String language
        -List~String~ command
    }
    BashCodingApp --> Settings: Uses
```


#### 3. User Message Handling Process

Finally, let's depict the process flow when handling a user message. This includes fetching settings, creating a `CodingAgent`, and starting it with the user's message.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant B as BashCodingApp
    participant S as Settings
    participant C as CodingAgent
    U->>B: Sends message
    B->>B: Fetches Settings for Session
    B->>S: Retrieves Session-specific Settings
    B->>C: Creates CodingAgent with Settings
    C->>C: Starts processing User Message
    C->>U: Sends response
```

These diagrams provide a visual documentation of the `BashCodingApp` class, highlighting its inheritance, settings management, and the user message handling process. By breaking down the documentation into these components, it becomes easier to understand the functionality and flow of the application.

# coding\GmailCodingApp.kt

To document the `GmailCodingApp` class and its interactions with other components, we can use Mermaid.js diagrams. Mermaid.js is a tool that allows the generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as Markdown. Below, we will create diagrams to represent the structure and flow of the `GmailCodingApp`.


#### Class Diagram

First, let's create a class diagram to show the relationship between `GmailCodingApp` and other classes it interacts with.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class GmailCodingApp {
      -applicationName: String
      -path: String
      +userMessage(session: Session, user: User, userMessage: String, ui: ApplicationInterface, api: API): void
      +getSymbols(gmailSvc: Gmail): Map
      +Settings: Class
      +initSettings(session: Session): T?
    }
    class Session
    class User {
      -credential: Credential
    }
    class ApplicationInterface
    class API
    class Gmail
    class KotlinInterpreter
    class ToolAgent {
      -api: API
      -dataStorage: Any
      -session: Session
      -user: User
      -ui: ApplicationInterface
      -interpreter: Class
      -symbols: Map
      -temperature: Double
      -model: ChatModels
      +start(userMessage: String): void
    }
    class Settings {
      -temperature: Double?
      -model: ChatModels
    }

    GmailCodingApp --> Session : uses
    GmailCodingApp --> User : uses
    GmailCodingApp --> ApplicationInterface : uses
    GmailCodingApp --> API : uses
    GmailCodingApp --> Gmail : uses
    GmailCodingApp --> KotlinInterpreter : uses
    GmailCodingApp --> ToolAgent : creates
    GmailCodingApp --> Settings : uses
    ToolAgent --> KotlinInterpreter : uses
    ToolAgent --> API : uses
    ToolAgent --> Session : uses
    ToolAgent --> User : uses
    ToolAgent --> ApplicationInterface : uses
```


#### Sequence Diagram

Next, let's create a sequence diagram to illustrate how a user message is processed by the `GmailCodingApp`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant GmailCodingApp as GmailCodingApp
    participant ToolAgent as ToolAgent<KotlinInterpreter>
    participant Gmail as Gmail
    participant KotlinInterpreter as KotlinInterpreter

    User->>GmailCodingApp: userMessage(session, user, userMessage, ui, api)
    GmailCodingApp->>Gmail: Builder(...)
    GmailCodingApp->>ToolAgent: new ToolAgent(api, dataStorage, session, user, ui, KotlinInterpreter, symbols, temperature, model)
    ToolAgent->>KotlinInterpreter: new KotlinInterpreter()
    ToolAgent->>ToolAgent: start(userMessage)
    Note over ToolAgent,KotlinInterpreter: Processing and executing user message
```

These diagrams provide a visual representation of the `GmailCodingApp` class structure and its interaction flow when processing a user message. The class diagram shows the relationships and dependencies between classes, while the sequence diagram illustrates the steps taken when a user message is received and processed.

# coding\AwsCodingApp.kt

To document the `AwsCodingApp` class and its functionality using mermaid.js diagrams, we'll break down the process into several parts, focusing on the class structure, the flow of the `userMessage` method, and the settings management. This approach will help in understanding the overall architecture and the specific processes within the `AwsCodingApp`.


#### Class Structure

First, let's visualize the class hierarchy and relationships:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    ApplicationServer <|-- AwsCodingApp
    AwsCodingApp : +userMessage(session, user, userMessage, ui, api)
    AwsCodingApp : +Settings(region, profile, temperature, model)
    AwsCodingApp : +settingsClass
    AwsCodingApp : +initSettings(session)
    AwsCodingApp : +fromString(str)
    AwsCodingApp : +getSymbols(region, profile)
    ApplicationServer : +applicationName
    ApplicationServer : +path
    class ToolAgent {
        +start(userMessage)
    }
    AwsCodingApp --> "1" ToolAgent : Uses
    class KotlinInterpreter
    ToolAgent --> "1" KotlinInterpreter : Interprets
```

This diagram shows the `AwsCodingApp` class extending `ApplicationServer` and its relationship with `ToolAgent` and `KotlinInterpreter`. It highlights the main components and methods within `AwsCodingApp`, including the `Settings` data class and utility methods like `fromString` and `getSymbols`.


#### User Message Handling Flow

Next, let's illustrate the flow when handling a user message through the `userMessage` method:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant AwsCodingApp as AwsCodingApp
    participant ToolAgent as ToolAgent
    participant KotlinInterpreter as KotlinInterpreter

    User->>AwsCodingApp: Sends userMessage
    AwsCodingApp->>AwsCodingApp: Retrieves Settings
    AwsCodingApp->>ToolAgent: Creates with KotlinInterpreter, symbols, etc.
    loop Processing Message
        ToolAgent->>KotlinInterpreter: Interprets userMessage
    end
    ToolAgent->>User: Sends response
```

This sequence diagram demonstrates how a user message is processed by the `AwsCodingApp`. It starts with the user sending a message, followed by the app retrieving settings, creating a `ToolAgent` instance configured with a `KotlinInterpreter`, and processing the message. Finally, the response is sent back to the user.


#### Settings Management

Lastly, let's depict how settings are managed within the `AwsCodingApp`:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AwsCodingApp {
        +Settings settings
        +initSettings(session)
        +getSettings(session, user)
    }
    class Settings {
        -region
        -profile
        -temperature
        -model
    }
    AwsCodingApp --> Settings : Manages
```

This class diagram focuses on the `Settings` management within the `AwsCodingApp`. It shows the `Settings` data class and its relationship with the main app class, highlighting how settings are initialized and retrieved.

By combining these diagrams, we can provide a comprehensive documentation of the `AwsCodingApp` class, covering its structure, key functionalities, and the flow of processing user messages.

# coding\JDBCCodingApp.kt

To document the `JDBCCodingApp` class and its interactions using Mermaid.js, we'll break down the process into several key components and interactions. This will include the initialization of the application, handling user messages, establishing JDBC connections, and utilizing the Kotlin interpreter with custom symbols.


#### Application Initialization

First, let's visualize the initialization process of the `JDBCCodingApp`, focusing on how it extends `ApplicationServer` and sets up its basic configuration.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ApplicationServer {
        +String applicationName
        +String path
    }
    class JDBCCodingApp {
        +Settings settings
        +userMessage(session, user, userMessage, ui, api)
        +getSymbols(jdbcConnection)
    }
    ApplicationServer <|-- JDBCCodingApp: Extends
```


#### Handling User Messages

When a user sends a message, the `userMessage` method is invoked. This method is responsible for creating a JDBC connection based on user-specific settings and starting a `ToolAgent` with a Kotlin interpreter and custom symbols.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant JDBCCodingApp as JDBCCodingApp
    participant DriverManager as DriverManager
    participant ToolAgent as ToolAgent<KotlinInterpreter>
    User->>JDBCCodingApp: Sends message
    JDBCCodingApp->>DriverManager: getConnection(settings)
    DriverManager-->>JDBCCodingApp: jdbcConnection
    JDBCCodingApp->>ToolAgent: Start(userMessage, symbols)
    ToolAgent->>KotlinInterpreter: Execute with symbols
```


#### Establishing JDBC Connections

The JDBC connection is established using the `DriverManager.getConnection` method, which utilizes settings provided by the user or defaults defined in the `Settings` data class.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class JDBCCodingApp {
        +Settings settings
    }
    class DriverManager {
        +getConnection(url, user, password)
    }
    class Settings {
        +String jdbcUrl
        +String jdbcUser
        +String jdbcPassword
    }
    JDBCCodingApp --> DriverManager : Uses
    JDBCCodingApp --> Settings : Has
```


#### Utilizing Kotlin Interpreter with Custom Symbols

The `ToolAgent` is initialized with a Kotlin interpreter and a set of custom symbols derived from the JDBC connection. This allows for dynamic execution of Kotlin code with database interaction capabilities.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ToolAgent {
        +KotlinInterpreter interpreter
        +Map symbols
        +start(userMessage)
    }
    class KotlinInterpreter {
    }
    class JDBCSupplier {
        -Connection jdbcConnection
        +accept(function)
    }
    class Connection {
    }
    ToolAgent --> KotlinInterpreter : Uses
    ToolAgent --> JDBCSupplier : Uses "withConnection" symbol
    JDBCSupplier --> Connection : Holds
```

    end

    deactivate OutlineAgent
    OutlineAgent-->>OutlineApp: completed outline
    deactivate OutlineApp
    OutlineApp-->>User: display outline
```


#### Explanation

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the `OutlineApp` by sending a message (userMessage) that contains the main idea or topic for outline generation.
2. **OutlineApp Initialization**: Upon receiving the user's message, `OutlineApp` initializes the `OutlineAgent` with the necessary settings and information.
3. **Outline Generation Process**:
   - The `OutlineAgent` starts by generating an initial outline using the `OutlineManager`.
   - It then enters a loop to iteratively expand each node of the outline to add depth and detail. This process involves the `OutlineManager` and may use different AI models as specified in the settings.
4. **Finalization**:
   - Once the outline is fully expanded, `OutlineAgent` uses `OutlineManager` to compile the expanded nodes into a final outline.
   - Optionally, if enabled in the settings, `OutlineAgent` may also use the API to visualize embeddings of the outline sections or to write a final essay based on the outline.
5. **User Feedback**: The completed outline (and any additional outputs like visualizations or essays) is sent back to the user through the `OutlineApp`.

This documentation provides a high-level overview and detailed interaction flow within the `OutlineApp` system, utilizing mermaid.js diagrams for clear visualization.

    }
    class ParsedActor {
        -prompt String
        -model ApiModel
        -parsingModel ApiModel
    }
    class CodingActor {
        -interpreterClass Class
        -model ApiModel
        -details String
    }
    class SimpleActor {
        -model ApiModel
        -prompt String
    }
    class ImageActor {
        -textModel ApiModel
    }
    ExampleActors --> ParsedActor: creates
    ExampleActors --> CodingActor: creates
    ExampleActors --> SimpleActor: creates
    ExampleActors --> ImageActor: creates
```


#### Interaction with `API`

Next, let's visualize how `ExampleActors` interacts with the `API` to process requests and generate responses.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ExampleActors
    participant API
    participant Actor

    User->>ExampleActors: Request (e.g., useExampleParsedActor)
    ExampleActors->>Actor: Create specific Actor (ParsedActor, CodingActor, etc.)
    Actor->>API: Send request with prompt
    API->>Actor: Return response
    Actor->>ExampleActors: Process response
    ExampleActors->>User: Return processed response
```


#### Detailed Interaction for a Specific Actor

For a more detailed view, let's focus on the interaction involving a specific actor, such as `ParsedActor`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ExampleActors
    participant ParsedActor
    participant API

    User->>ExampleActors: useExampleParsedActor()
    ExampleActors->>ParsedActor: Create with specific prompt and models
    ParsedActor->>API: Send parsing request
    API->>ParsedActor: Return parsed result
    ParsedActor->>ExampleActors: Return parsed object (ExampleResult)
    ExampleActors->>User: Display parsed data
```

These diagrams provide a structured visual representation of the `ExampleActors` interface, showcasing the creation of different actor types and their interactions with the `API` to process and respond to user requests. Through mermaid.js, we can effectively document and communicate the architecture and workflow of the system.

# premium\PresentationDesignerApp.kt

To document the `PresentationDesignerApp` and its associated classes using mermaid.js diagrams, we will focus on illustrating the flow of operations and the interactions between different components of the application. This will help in understanding the overall architecture and the sequence of actions that take place during the presentation generation process.


#### Application Overview Diagram

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the `PresentationDesignerApp`, showing the main components and their interactions.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    PresentationDesignerApp-->|manages|ApplicationServer;
    PresentationDesignerApp-->|uses|API;
    PresentationDesignerApp-->|interacts with|PresentationDesignerAgent;
    PresentationDesignerAgent-->|performs|ActorSystem;
    ActorSystem-->|utilizes|PresentationDesignerActors;
    PresentationDesignerActors-->|comprises|Actors[Actors (Initial Author, Content Expander, etc.)];
    Actors-->|generate|Content[Content (Ideas, Slides, Notes)];
    Content-->|presented by|UI[User Interface];
    UI-->|receives input from|User;
    User-->|sends request to|PresentationDesignerApp;
```


#### Detailed Interaction Flow

This diagram zooms into the detailed interaction flow within the `PresentationDesignerApp`, especially focusing on how a user request is processed to generate a presentation.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant PresentationDesignerApp as App
    participant PresentationDesignerAgent as Agent
    participant Actors as PresentationDesignerActors
    participant API
    participant UI

    User->>App: Sends presentation request
    App->>Agent: Initializes with session and settings
    Agent->>Actors: Fetches specific actors
    Actors->>Actors: Initial Author generates ideas
    Actors->>Actors: Content Expander creates detailed content
    Actors->>Actors: Slide Layout and Summary
    Actors->>Actors: Speaker Notes and Image Renderer
    Actors->>API: Calls external APIs for content enhancement
    Actors->>Agent: Returns generated content
    Agent->>UI: Presents generated slides and notes
    UI->>User: Displays presentation output
```


#### Component Interaction Diagram

This diagram illustrates the interactions between the core components of the `PresentationDesignerActors`, showcasing the flow from receiving a user request to generating the final presentation content.

```mermaid
graph LR;
    UserRequest[User Request] -->|input| InitialAuthor[Initial Author];
    InitialAuthor -->|generates| Outline[Outline of Ideas];
    Outline -->|expanded by| ContentExpander[Content Expander];
    ContentExpander -->|detailed content| SlideDetails[Slide Details];
    SlideDetails -->|styled by| SlideFormatter[Slide Formatter];
    SlideDetails -->|summarized by| SlideSummarizer[Slide Summarizer];
    SlideDetails -->|visuals by| ImageRenderer[Image Renderer];
    SlideDetails -->|notes by| SpeakerNotes[Speaker Notes];
    SlideFormatter & SlideSummarizer & ImageRenderer & SpeakerNotes -->|combined| FinalPresentation[Final Presentation Content];
    FinalPresentation -->|presented to| UserInterface[User Interface];
```

These diagrams provide a structured visual representation of the `PresentationDesignerApp` and its components, making it easier to understand the application's architecture and flow. Mermaid.js offers a convenient way to create and integrate such diagrams into documentation, enhancing clarity and comprehension.
